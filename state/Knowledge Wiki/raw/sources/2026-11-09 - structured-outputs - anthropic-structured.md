  Structured outputs

 Feature of  Messages API 
 APIs  Messages API Available  Managed Agents Not available 
 Cloud platforms  All platforms 
 Data handling  ZDR eligible Qualified  HIPAA eligible 

 Structured outputs constrain Claude’s responses to follow a specific schema, ensuring valid, parseable output for downstream processing. Structured outputs provide two complementary features:

 JSON outputs ( output_config.format ): Get Claude’s response in a specific JSON format, for example to extract data from images or text, generate structured reports, or format API responses. This page covers JSON outputs.

 Strict tool use ( strict: true ): Guarantee schema validation on tool names and inputs. See Strict tool use .

 You can use these features independently or together in the same request .

 Why use structured outputs  

 Without structured outputs, Claude can generate malformed JSON responses or invalid tool inputs that break your applications. Even with careful prompting, you might encounter:

 Parsing errors from invalid JSON syntax

 Missing required fields

 Inconsistent data types

 Schema violations requiring error handling and retries

 Structured outputs guarantee schema-compliant responses through constrained decoding:

 Always valid: No more JSON.parse() errors

 Type safe: Guaranteed field types and required fields

 Reliable: No retries needed for schema violations

 How it works  

 1 
 Define your schema
 Describe the structure you want as a JSON schema or as a type in your language. The schema follows JSON Schema, with some limitations .

 2 
 Send it in output_config.format
 The request carries the schema in output_config.format with type: "json_schema" . SDK helpers set this for you.

 3 
 Read the response
 Claude returns valid JSON that matches your schema in the response’s text content block. SDK helpers parse it into your type.

 Usage  

 cURL CLI Python TypeScript C# Go Java PHP Ruby 

 Python 

 from pydantic import BaseModel 
 # ... 

 class ContactInfo ( BaseModel ): 
 name: str 
 email: str 
 plan_interest: str 
 demo_requested: bool 

 client = Anthropic() 
 
 response = client.messages.parse( 
 model = "claude-opus-5-5" , 
 max_tokens = 1024 , 
 messages = [ 
 { 
 "role" : "user" , 
 "content" : ( 
 "Extract the key information from this email: " 
 "John Smith (john@example.com) is interested in our Enterprise plan " 
 "and wants to schedule a demo for next Tuesday at 2pm." 
 ), 
 } 
 ], 
 output_format = ContactInfo, 
 ) 
 
 print (response.parsed_output) 

  

 Pass a Pydantic model to client.messages.parse() , the recommended method, as output_format . The SDK transforms the model’s schema, sends it as output_config.format , validates the response, and returns the parsed model in parsed_output .
 The previous example outputs:
 Output
  

 name='John Smith' email='john@example.com' plan_interest='Enterprise' demo_requested=True 

 How SDK transformation works  

 Most SDK helpers transform schemas that use unsupported features. The transformation steps:

 Remove unsupported constraints (for example, minimum , maximum , minLength , maxLength )

 Update descriptions by adding each unsupported constraint to the field’s description (for example, {minimum: 100} )

 Add additionalProperties: false to all objects

 Filter string formats to the supported list only

 Validate responses against your original schema and all its constraints, if the helper validates responses

 Claude receives a simplified schema, but a helper that validates responses still enforces every constraint in your code.

 Example: A field with minimum: 100 becomes a plain integer in the sent schema, and the SDK adds {minimum: 100} to the field’s description. A helper that validates responses still checks the response against minimum: 100 .

 Using a raw JSON schema  

 To use a JSON schema from a file, an OpenAPI spec, or code that builds it at runtime, pass it in output_config.format .

 cURL CLI Python TypeScript C# Go Java PHP Ruby 

 Python 

 client = anthropic.Anthropic() 
 
 response = client.messages.create( 
 model = "claude-opus-5-5" , 
 max_tokens = 1024 , 
 messages = [ 
 { 
 "role" : "user" , 
 "content" : ( 
 "Extract the key information from this email: " 
 "John Smith (john@example.com) is interested in our Enterprise plan " 
 "and wants to schedule a demo for next Tuesday at 2pm." 
 ), 
 } 
 ], 
 output_config = { 
 "format" : { 
 "type" : "json_schema" , 
 "schema" : { 
 "type" : "object" , 
 "properties" : { 
 "name" : { "type" : "string" }, 
 "email" : { "type" : "string" }, 
 "plan_interest" : { "type" : "string" }, 
 "demo_requested" : { "type" : "boolean" }, 
 }, 
 "required" : [ "name" , "email" , "plan_interest" , "demo_requested" ], 
 "additionalProperties" : False , 
 }, 
 } 
 }, 
 ) 
 text = next (block.text for block in response.content if block.type == "text" ) 
 contact = json.loads(text) 
 print (contact) 

  

 The previous example outputs:
 Output
  

 {'name': 'John Smith', 'email': 'john@example.com', 'plan_interest': 'Enterprise', 'demo_requested': True} 

 To move constraints not supported by the API into field descriptions, pass the schema through transform_schema() from the anthropic package before sending it, and edit the result if you need to. transform_schema() also accepts a Pydantic model. Unlike client.messages.parse() , it returns the transformed schema rather than sending it.

 Common use cases  

 Data extraction  
 Extract structured data from unstructured text:
 cURL CLI Python TypeScript C# Go Java PHP Ruby 

 Python 
  

 from pydantic import BaseModel 

 class Invoice ( BaseModel ): 
 invoice_number: str 
 date: str 
 total_amount: float 
 line_items: list[ dict ] 
 customer_name: str 

 client = anthropic.Anthropic() 
 invoice_text = "Invoice #12345, Date: 2024-01-15, Total: $500.00" 
 
 response = client.messages.parse( 
 model = "claude-opus-5-5" , 
 max_tokens = 4096 , 
 output_format = Invoice, 
 messages = [ 
 { "role" : "user" , "content" : f "Extract invoice data from: { invoice_text } " } 
 ], 
 ) 
 
 print (response.parsed_output) 

 Classification  
 Classify content with structured categories:
 cURL CLI Python TypeScript C# Go Java PHP Ruby 

 Python 
  

 from pydantic import BaseModel 
 
 client = Anthropic() 

 class Classification ( BaseModel ): 
 category: str 
 confidence: float 
 tags: list[ str ] 
 sentiment: str 

 feedback_text = "Great product, but the delivery was slow." 
 response = client.messages.parse( 
 model = "claude-opus-5-5" , 
 max_tokens = 1024 , 
 output_format = Classification, 
 messages = [{ "role" : "user" , "content" : f "Classify this feedback: { feedback_text } " }], 
 ) 
 
 print (response.parsed_output) 

 API response formatting  
 Generate API-ready responses:
 cURL CLI Python TypeScript C# Go Java PHP Ruby 

 Python 
  

 from pydantic import BaseModel 
 
 client = Anthropic() 

 class APIResponse ( BaseModel ): 
 status: str 
 data: dict 
 errors: list[ dict ] | None 
 metadata: dict 

 response = client.messages.parse( 
 model = "claude-opus-5-5" , 
 max_tokens = 1024 , 
 output_format = APIResponse, 
 messages = [{ "role" : "user" , "content" : "Process this request: ..." }], 
 ) 
 
 print (response.parsed_output) 

 Strict tool use  

 To enforce JSON Schema compliance on tool inputs with grammar-constrained sampling, see Strict tool use .

 Using both features together  

 JSON outputs and strict tool use solve different problems and work together:

 JSON outputs control Claude’s response format (what Claude says).

 Strict tool use validates tool parameters (how Claude calls your functions).

 When combined, Claude can call tools with guaranteed-valid parameters AND return structured JSON responses. This is useful for agentic workflows where you need both reliable tool calls and structured final outputs.

 cURL CLI Python TypeScript C# Go Java PHP Ruby 

 Python 
  

 client = anthropic.Anthropic() 
 
 response = client.messages.create( 
 model = "claude-opus-5-5" , 
 max_tokens = 1024 , 
 messages = [ 
 { 
 "role" : "user" , 
 "content" : "Help me plan a trip to Paris departing May 15, 2026" , 
 } 
 ], 
 # JSON outputs: structured response format 
 output_config = { 
 "format" : { 
 "type" : "json_schema" , 
 "schema" : { 
 "type" : "object" , 
 "properties" : { 
 "summary" : { "type" : "string" }, 
 "next_steps" : { "type" : "array" , "items" : { "type" : "string" }}, 
 }, 
 "required" : [ "summary" , "next_steps" ], 
 "additionalProperties" : False , 
 }, 
 } 
 }, 
 # Strict tool use: guaranteed tool parameters 
 tools = [ 
 { 
 "name" : "search_flights" , 
 "strict" : True , 
 "input_schema" : { 
 "type" : "object" , 
 "properties" : { 
 "destination" : { "type" : "string" }, 
 "date" : { "type" : "string" , "format" : "date" }, 
 }, 
 "required" : [ "destination" , "date" ], 
 "additionalProperties" : False , 
 }, 
 } 
 ], 
 ) 
 
 print (response) 

 Important considerations  

 Grammar compilation and caching  

 Structured outputs use constrained sampling with compiled grammar artifacts. This introduces some performance characteristics to be aware of:

 First request latency: The first time you use a specific schema, there is additional latency while the grammar compiles.

 Automatic caching: Compiled grammars are cached for 24 hours from last use, making subsequent requests much faster.

 Cache invalidation: The cache is invalidated if you change the JSON schema structure or, when using both structured outputs and tool use, the set of tools in your request. Changing only name or description fields does not invalidate the cache.

 Prompt modification and token costs  

 When using structured outputs, Claude automatically receives an additional system prompt explaining the expected output format. This means:

 Your input token count is slightly higher.

 The injected prompt costs you tokens like any other system prompt.

 Changing the output_config.format parameter will invalidate any prompt cache for that conversation thread.

 JSON Schema limitations  

 Structured outputs support standard JSON Schema with some limitations. Both JSON outputs and strict tool use share these limitations.

 Supported features  
 
 All basic types: object, array, string, integer, number, boolean, null

 enum (strings, numbers, booleans, or nulls only, no complex types). For a capitalization caveat, see Invalid outputs .

 const 

 anyOf and allOf (with limitations: allOf with $ref not supported)

 $ref , $def , and definitions (external $ref not supported)

 default property for all supported types

 required and additionalProperties (must be set to false for objects)

 String formats: date-time , time , date , duration , email , hostname , uri , ipv4 , ipv6 , uuid 

 Array minItems (only values 0 and 1 supported)

 Not supported  
 
 Recursive schemas

 Complex types within enums

 External $ref (for example, '$ref': 'http://...' )

 Numerical constraints (such as minimum , maximum , multipleOf )

 String constraints ( minLength , maxLength )

 Array constraints beyond minItems of 0 or 1

 additionalProperties set to anything other than false 

 If you use an unsupported feature, you’ll receive a 400 error with details.

 Pattern support (regex)  
 Supported regex features: 
 
 Full matching ( ^...$ ) and partial matching

 Quantifiers: * , + , ? , simple {n,m} cases

 Character classes: [] , . , \d , \w , \s 

 Groups: (...) 

 NOT supported: 
 
 Backreferences to groups (for example, \1 , \2 )

 Lookahead/lookbehind assertions (for example, (?=...) , (?!...) )

 Word boundaries: \b , \B 

 Complex {n,m} quantifiers with large ranges

 Simple regex patterns work well. Complex patterns might result in 400 errors.

  SDK helpers can transform schemas with constraints not supported by the API . See How SDK transformation works .

 Property ordering  

 When using structured outputs, properties in objects maintain their defined ordering from your schema, with one important caveat: required properties appear first, followed by optional properties .

 For example, given this schema:

 { 
 "type" : "object" , 
 "properties" : { 
 "notes" : { "type" : "string" }, 
 "name" : { "type" : "string" }, 
 "email" : { "type" : "string" }, 
 "age" : { "type" : "integer" } 
 }, 
 "required" : [ "name" , "email" ], 
 "additionalProperties" : false 
 } 

  

 The output will order properties as:

 name (required, in schema order)

 email (required, in schema order)

 notes (optional, in schema order)

 age (optional, in schema order)

 This means the output might look like:

 { 
 "name" : "John Smith" , 
 "email" : "john@example.com" , 
 "notes" : "Interested in enterprise plan" , 
 "age" : 35 
 } 

  

 If property order in the output is important to your application, mark all properties as required, or account for this reordering in your parsing logic.

 Invalid outputs  

 Although structured outputs guarantee schema compliance in most cases, there are scenarios where the output might not match your schema:

 Refusals ( stop_reason: "refusal" )

 Claude maintains its safety and helpfulness properties even when using structured outputs. If Claude refuses a request for safety reasons:

 The response has stop_reason: "refusal" .

 You’ll receive a 200 status code.

 You’ll be billed for the tokens generated.

 The output might not match your schema because the refusal message takes precedence over schema constraints.

 A property that asks for the model’s thinking or step-by-step reasoning might lead to a reasoning_extraction refusal. Ask for a short explanation instead. See Keep reasoning in thinking blocks .

 Token limit reached ( stop_reason: "max_tokens" )

 If the response is cut off because it reached the max_tokens limit:

 The response has stop_reason: "max_tokens" .

 The output might be incomplete and not match your schema.

 Retry with a higher max_tokens value to get the complete structured output.

 Enum value casing 

 Structured outputs don’t guarantee the capitalization of string enum and const values: Claude might return a value that differs from your schema only in capitalization, typically in the first letter of a word following a space. For example, given this schema:

 { 
 "type" : "string" , 
 "enum" : [ "Conversation Topic 1" , "Conversation Topic 2" , "Conversation topic 3" ] 
 } 

  

 The output might contain "Conversation Topic 3" (capital “T”) even though that exact value isn’t in the enum. The response completes normally, with no error and no special stop_reason . This applies to both JSON outputs and strict tool use. Compare enum values case-insensitively, and avoid enum values that differ only in capitalization.

 Schema complexity limits  

 Structured outputs work by compiling your JSON schemas into a grammar that constrains Claude’s output. More complex schemas produce larger grammars that take longer to compile. To protect against excessive compilation times, the API enforces several complexity limits.

 Explicit limits  

 The following limits apply to all requests with output_config.format or strict: true :

 Limit Value Description 
 Strict tools per request 20 Maximum number of tools with strict: true . Non-strict tools don’t count toward this limit. 
 Optional parameters 24 Total optional parameters across all strict tool schemas and JSON output schemas. Each parameter not listed in required counts toward this limit. 
 Parameters with union types 16 Total parameters that use anyOf or type arrays (for example, "type": ["string", "null"] ) across all strict schemas. These are especially expensive because they create exponential compilation cost. 

  These limits apply to the combined total across all strict schemas in a single request. For example, if you have 4 strict tools with 6 optional parameters each, you’ll reach the 24-parameter limit even though no single tool seems complex.

 Additional internal limits  

 Beyond the explicit limits in the preceding table, there are additional internal limits on the compiled grammar size. These limits exist because schema complexity doesn’t reduce to a single dimension: features such as optional parameters, union types, nested objects, and number of tools interact with each other in ways that can make the compiled grammar disproportionately large.

 When these limits are exceeded, you’ll receive a 400 error with the message “Schema is too complex for compilation.” These errors mean the combined complexity of your schemas exceeds what can be efficiently compiled, even if each individual limit in the preceding table is satisfied. As a final stop-gap, the API also enforces a compilation timeout of 180 seconds . Schemas that pass all explicit checks but produce very large compiled grammars might hit this timeout.

 Tips for reducing schema complexity  

 If you’re hitting complexity limits, try these strategies in order:

 Mark only critical tools as strict. If you have many tools, reserve strict tool use for those where schema violations cause real problems, and rely on Claude’s natural adherence for simpler tools.

 Reduce optional parameters. Make parameters required where possible. Each optional parameter roughly doubles a portion of the grammar’s state space. If a parameter always has a reasonable default, consider making it required and having Claude provide that default explicitly.

 Simplify nested structures. Deeply nested objects with optional fields compound the complexity. Flatten structures where possible.

 Split into multiple requests. If you have many strict tools, consider splitting them across separate requests or subagents.

 For persistent issues with valid schemas, contact support with your schema definition.

 Migrating from the beta  

 The output_format parameter has moved to output_config.format , and beta headers are no longer required. The output_format parameter is deprecated. To use it anyway, add the structured-outputs-2025-11-13 beta header. Without it, the API returns a 400 error.

 The Python SDK (v1.0 and later) does not accept output_format={...} on client.beta.messages.create() or count_tokens() and raises a TypeError . Use output_config instead. See Using a raw JSON schema for the updated API shape.

 Feature compatibility  

 Works with: 

 Batch processing : Process structured outputs at scale with a 50 percent discount

 Token counting : Count tokens without compilation

 Streaming : Stream structured outputs like normal responses

 Combined usage : Use JSON outputs ( output_config.format ) and strict tool use ( strict: true ) together in the same request

 Incompatible with: 

 Citations : Citations require interleaving citation blocks with text, which conflicts with strict JSON schema constraints. The API returns a 400 error if citations are enabled with output_config.format . To extract structured data with a citation for each value, see Get structured data with citations .

 Message prefilling: Prefilling is incompatible with JSON outputs.

  Grammar scope: Grammars apply only to Claude’s direct output, not to tool use calls, tool results, or thinking tags (when using thinking ). Grammar state resets between sections, allowing Claude to think freely while still producing structured output in the final response.

 HIPAA  Eligible 
 PHI must not be included in JSON schema definitions; see PHI handling guidelines. Learn more 

 Prompts and responses are processed with ZDR when using structured outputs. However, the JSON schema itself is temporarily cached for up to 24 hours since last use for optimization purposes. No prompt or response data is retained beyond the API response.
 Structured outputs are HIPAA eligible, but PHI must not be included in JSON schema definitions . The API compiles JSON schemas into grammars that are cached separately from message content, and these cached schemas do not receive the same PHI protections as prompts and responses. Do not include PHI in schema property names, enum values, const values, or pattern regular expressions. PHI should only appear in message content (prompts and responses), where it is protected under HIPAA safeguards.
